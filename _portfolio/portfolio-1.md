## Image analysis workshop

Speakers: 
 - Prof. Balz Kamber: introduction
 - Dr. Marco Acevedo Zamora: exercises

All the material for the seminar is in a freely distributed Google Drive [folder](). For those who experience difficulties downloading all the data, helping PhD students around the room can copy you the files with SSD external drives. The description and links to the specific datasets are given below.

The required material, data and external software are:
 - Guidelines for the seminar: [booklet_11-Nov-25.pdf](). 
 - Part 1: 
 - Part 2: 
 - QuPath v0.6: 
    - QuPath for Windows: 
    - The installer can also be downloaded at: https://qupath.github.io/
 - ImageJ (optional): https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads
 - IrfanView (optional): https://www.irfanview.com/

The links to download the image analysis software **executables** are (only run in Windows 11):
 - [Cube converter]()
 - [Chemistry simplifier]()
 - [Phase interpreter]()

All software are in version 1 (beta) and this is a first time release. If you wish to have the source code, fork and contribute to improve the software, the repositories are in GitHub:
 - [Cube converter repository](https://github.com/marcoaaz/cube_converter)
 - [Chemistry simplifier v1 repository](https://github.com/marcoaaz/chemistry_simplifier)
 - [Phase interpreter v1 repository](https://github.com/marcoaaz/phase_interpreter)


### Workflow

The overall workflow below shows the type of microscopy data and how it will flow between the software packages and give you an idea of your progress:

Remember that all data management and software interaction are done manually. It's 2025! :blush:. If you liked the seminar, the best support is to cite our scientific work and collaborate with us. 

Cheers,
