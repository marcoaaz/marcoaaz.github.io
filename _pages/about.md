Hopefully you will find useful some of the software that I made and regularly use for analysing images during my latest research projects. They are free and open-source in order to be sustainable. Further updates that increase the number of options, reliability and performance will be driven by user feedback and my available resources. 

Everyone is welcome to contribute to build this expanding research field.

I will be running a seminar of the software tools that are listed in the Portfolio tab. Further descriptions and updates will be given soon and adapt to the users.
